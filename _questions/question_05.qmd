### Exercise 5: Sketching Out the Way Forward 

(a) Share your bullet point responses to Question 3 (“Where should we start?”) with your group.

(b) As a group, discuss:

- Which responses feel realistic and well thought-through?
- Which ones show a good understanding of how business context and data interact?
- Which approaches would be easiest to communicate to a stakeholder who doesn't know the data?

(c) Choose the group member’s response that you think offers the strongest starting point.
Write it down and explain why—what makes it practical, well-reasoned, or insightful?

🎯 **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Evaluate analytical plans based on how well they connect business context, data, and decision-making
- Practice identifying what makes an analytical approach realistic, well-reasoned, and communicable
- Begin to recognize the difference between technically impressive plans and strategically effective ones

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

**A strong plan does not need to be overly technical.**
What matters is whether the steps are logical, feasible, and clearly connected to the business problem.

Good responses should reflect:

- Understanding of the business context (e.g. Uber’s pricing, platform dynamics, driver incentives)
- Feasibility — can the data or insights be realistically accessed and interpreted?
- Prioritization — starting with high-signal, high-feasibility directions instead of jumping to the most complex tools
- Anticipation of communication needs — who will need to hear about the results, and how?

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“If you had to act on one plan in your group tomorrow, which one would you pick?”

“Did anyone’s plan anticipate stakeholder communication needs?”

“Was there a plan that skipped context or felt hard to implement?”

“Which plans reflected the business scientist mindset—not just analysis, but action?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings** 

- Assuming more bullet points = better
- Prioritizing technical detail over business relevance
- Forgetting that findings will need to be explained clearly to non-specialists
- Treating the task like a coding plan rather than an analytical plan

*NOTE: This is just one possible approach. Group responses will vary depending on what each person focused on in Question 3. The important thing is to reason clearly about why one starting point is especially strong.*

Selected starting point (from a group member):

“I’d analyze log-on/off patterns and price spikes to look for signs of coordinated behavior, then follow up with internal interviews and forum monitoring to understand what drivers know and share. I’d also prepare simple visuals and clear language to help explain the issue to product and policy teams.”

Why this is a strong approach:

- It begins with observable behavior in the data that can be tracked and tested
- It considers context and incentives, not just technical detection
- It blends data exploration, institutional knowledge, and communication planning
- It’s practical and well-scoped — not overambitious for a first analysis, but still meaningful
- It anticipates the need to translate findings to decision-makers with different levels of technical knowledge
