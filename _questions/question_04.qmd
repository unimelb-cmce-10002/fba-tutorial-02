### Exercise 4: Defining a Problem and Crafting Questions

(a) Share your business context descriptions and research questions (from Question 2) with your group.

(b) As a group, discuss:

- Which context descriptions are clear and well-framed?
- Which research questions are answerable using data?
- Which questions are most likely to help Uber make a better decision?

(c) Choose the best research question your group came up with.
Write down the question and explain why you chose it. What makes it clear, useful, or powerful?

## Conversation prompt  
Are your group's questions descriptive (what happened), predictive (what will happen), or causal (why did it happen)? How does that shape the analysis?

🎯  **Learning Objective**
Students should:

- Practice designing an analytical approach to an open-ended business problem
- Demonstrate an understanding of how business theory, data discovery, and modeling fit together
- Reflect on how different business scientist skills are activated in real investigations
- Begin thinking about how to communicate findings clearly to decision-makers

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

Strong context descriptions:

- Show awareness of how the platform operates (e.g. how surge pricing works, what drivers see, what Uber optimizes for)
- Include relevant institutional details like incentives, geography, timing, and stakeholder perspectives (drivers, riders, Uber’s trust and operations teams)
- Avoid generic or vague descriptions like “Uber’s app isn’t working well” or “there’s a pricing issue”
- Reflect a thoughtful diagnosis of the situation before jumping to a solution

In a platform setting like Uber, a good research question should be:

- Clear and specific — avoids vague terms like “better” or “fix the problem”
- Framed with context — refers to real parts of the business (pricing, driver activity, customer experience)
- Answerable with realistic data — logs, timing, location, earnings, cancellations, etc.
- Tied to a decision — ideally something Uber could act on: detection, prevention, communication, or redesign
- Appropriately scoped — not too broad, not too narrow

Also introduce the three types of analytical questions:

- Descriptive: What happened?
- Predictive: What’s likely to happen next?
- Causal: Did X cause Y?

Each type implies different methods, assumptions, and risks. Encourage students to identify what kind of question their group’s best option is.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Which context descriptions in your group showed a strong understanding of how Uber’s platform works?”

“Which ones helped you see why the issue matters—not just what the issue is?”

“What kind of knowledge helped make those descriptions clearer or more useful?”

“Would this question help a decision-maker at Uber do something differently?”

“What data would we need to answer it—and could Uber reasonably access that?”

“Is the question asking about what happened, what will happen, or why it happened?”

“Why is this group’s research question stronger than others? What makes it more actionable or insightful?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Restating the article without adding interpretation or business context
- Describing symptoms but not identifying what might be causing them
- Ignoring how the platform’s design and incentives shape user behavior
- Choosing overly vague or sweeping questions with no clear path to analysis
- Treating more complicated or technical questions as automatically better
- Ignoring the platform dynamics—forgetting Uber has to serve both riders and drivers
- Prioritizing clever phrasing over clarity or business relevance
- Overlooking that a great question sets up the whole project—it’s not just academic!

There is no single “correct” research question. Instead, a your discussion should have focussed on:

1. A clear set of criteria for judging context descriptions and research questions, such as:
    - Clarity: Is the question specific and easy to understand?
    - Answerability: Could we answer it with available or realistic data?
    - Business relevance: Would answering this help Uber make better decision?
    - Scope: Is it neither too vague nor too narrow?
    - Analytical orientation: Is the question descriptive, predictive, or causal — and is that a good fit for the business problem?

2. A clear justification of which question is “best”
The group should select the most decision-relevant question and explain why it would be most useful to investigate.
