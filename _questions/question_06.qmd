### Exercise 6: Defining a Problem and Crafting Questions

(a) Share your draft research questions with your group.
(b) Discuss which questions are clear? Which are answerable with data? Which could help David Jones make a better decision?
(c) Which of the proposed questions is the "best". Explain why.

## Conversation prompt  
Are your group's questions descriptive (what happened), predictive (what will happen), or causal (why did it happen)? How does that shape the analysis?

🎯 Learning Objective
Students should:

Practise evaluating research questions against business and analytical criteria

Begin to distinguish between descriptive, predictive, and causal questions

Understand what makes a research question valuable in a business context

✅  **Core Concetpts to Highlight**

A good business analytics question should be:

- Clear and specific
- Avoids vague terms like "better" or "improve" without context
- Clearly defines what is being measured, where, and when
- Answerable with available or realistic data
- Avoids overly hypothetical questions or those requiring data that doesn’t exist
- Anchored in what the company could actually track (sales, promotions, delivery times, etc.)
- Tied to a business decision
- Supports action: changes in ordering, pricing, promotion, or staffing
- Doesn’t just explore curiosity — it has a “so what?”
- Appropriately scoped
- Not too broad (e.g. “How can David Jones improve Christmas?”)
- Not too narrow (e.g. “What happened on Dec 14 in Sydney?”)

Also, encourage students to classify the question type:

- Descriptive: What happened?
- Predictive: What is likely to happen?
- Causal: What effect did X have on Y?

Each type suggests different methods and data needs — and possibly different risks.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Does this question support a business decision?”

“Would a manager care about the answer to this question?”

“Could you realistically answer it with data from last year?”

“Is the question asking what happened (descriptive), what might happen (predictive), or why it happened (causal)?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

Thinking the most complex question is the best

Overemphasising academic phrasing over business clarity (there'll be plenty of that later in their degree!)

Failing to justify why the chosen question is more useful than others

📝 **Optional Extension Prompt**

“Revise one of your group's questions using what you’ve learned. How would you make it clearer, more answerable, or more useful?”

There is no single “correct” research question. Instead, a your discussion should have focussed on:

1. A clear set of criteria for judging research questions, such as:
    - Clarity: Is the question specific and easy to understand?
    - Answerability: Could we answer it with available or realistic data?
    - Business relevance: Would answering this help David Jones make a better inventory decision?
    - Scope: Is it neither too vague nor too narrow?
    - Analytical orientation: Is the question descriptive, predictive, or causal — and is that a good fit for the business problem?

✅ 2. A clear justification of which question is “best”
The group should select the most decision-relevant question and explain why it would be most useful to investigate.

A strong answer might be something like:

“We chose this question because it helps us predict future demand across regions, which directly informs how many units to order. It's also answerable with the data we already have.”
