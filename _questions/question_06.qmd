### Exercise 6: Logging into PositCloud 

::: {.callout-caution}
## Content Pivot

In this week's Workshop we are pivoting midway through to give you more time to get comfortable with the computing environment for this class, PositCloud. 

We know this is a sudden pivot in content. 
In future weeks, we don't anticipate sudden jumps in content in the middle of a session.
:::

Log in to Posit Cloud and launch your project.

a. Go to https://posit.cloud and log in using your university credentials.
b. Navigate to the “Shared with Me” tab on the left sidebar.
c. Find the project titled FBA - Getting Started (or your instructor will tell you the correct name).
d. Click the project to open it.
e. Wait for the RStudio session to finish loading — you should see the Console, Files, and Environment panes.

!!!! Lachlan Needs to check these are the correct steps.

🎯 Learning Objective
Students should:

- Successfully log in to Posit Cloud and navigate the interface
- Locate and open the correct instructor-provided project
- Understand the structure of the RStudio workspace
- Confirm that they are working in the correct project and directory

This builds student confidence using cloud-based tools and ensures they’re in the right place before starting analytical tasks.

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

- Cloud project structure: Posit Cloud projects are self-contained — each one has its own files, history, and environment.
- RStudio layout: Point out key panes (Console, Files, Environment, Viewer) and how they support different tasks.
- Working directory: Everything they run depends on being in the right project folder — `getwd()` confirms that.

💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts**

“Where do you see the project name? Can you confirm you're in the right one?”

“Try typing `getwd()` into the console — what do you see?”

“Let’s take 30 seconds to explore the Files pane — what kinds of files are already there?”

“If something seems missing or strange, what should you check first?”

Encourage light troubleshooting and peer support (e.g. “Check with the person next to you”).

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Students land on the wrong project (e.g., open a different shared file or get stuck in the homepage)
- Not realizing the RStudio session takes time to load (they try to click too fast or think it’s broken)
- Overlooking the getwd() check — leading to file errors later
