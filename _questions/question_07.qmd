### Exercise 7: Make Some Edits to Your Quarto Document

a. At the top of the document, in the YAML header, change the author: field to your full name.
b.  Edit the sentence below sentence so:
    - One word is bold by wrapping it in double asterisks: `**like this**`
    - Another word italic by wrapping it in single asterisks: `*like this*`
c. Add a new R code chunk that computes the answer to 2+2 and returns the answer:
d. Add another R code chunk that stores the answer to 2+2 a variable called `my_answer` and prints it.
e. Render the document and see the changes you have made.

🎯 **Learning Objective**

Students should:

- Edit metadata in the YAML header (e.g. author name)
- Apply Markdown formatting for bold and italic text
- Add and run basic R code chunks
- Understand the difference between direct expressions (e.g., `2 + 2`) and variable assignments (`my_answer <- 2 + 2`)
- Successfully render a document with both narrative and code edits.

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

YAML header: Controls document metadata (title, author, format); always wrapped in ---

Markdown syntax:

- Bold: `**word**` → word
- Italic: `*word*` → word

Code chunks:

- Use ` ```{r} ` to start an R chunk, end with

- Code chunks should be inserted in the body, not in the YAML
- Variable assignment: x <- 5 stores a value for later use

Rendering reruns the entire document — changes to both text and code will appear in the HTML output


💬 **Suggested In-Class Prompts** 

“How do you know if your formatting worked? Where does it show up in the rendered file?”

“What happens if you forget to wrap your bold word in `**`?”

“Where does `print(my_answer)` show up in your final output?”

“Try changing the number in `2 + 2` and re-rendering — what happens?”

Encourage students to experiment — this is about building comfort, not perfection.

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Editing code or text inside the YAML header (instead of below it)
- Forgetting the backticks in code chunks or misplacing them
- Not saving before rendering — leading to out-of-date output
- Typing Markdown formatting (** or *) but expecting it to work in the Console

**a**. Edit the `author` line:

```{yaml}
author: Sarah Smith
```

**b**. Here's one of infinite possibilities:

The **quick** brown fox jumps over the *lazy* dog

**c**.

```{r}
2 + 2
```

**d**.

```{r}
my_answer <- 2 + 2
print(my_answer)
```
