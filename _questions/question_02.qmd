### Exercise 2: Explaining Context and Identifying a Research Question 

Uber’s pricing system is designed to respond to real-time supply and demand. But as the video shows, driver behavior can complicate this—sometimes in ways the algorithm wasn’t built to anticipate.

Imagine you’re part of a team investigating the situation in Sydney and Melbourne.

In 3–4 sentences, explain how you would define the problem for Uber. Then, write one clear research question that your team could use to guide further analysis.

To help you think through this, you might want to consider the following:

- What’s really going wrong here? 
- Why does it matter to the business? 
- What kind of evidence or data would help clarify the situation?

🎯 **Learning Objectives**

Students should:

- Practice defining ambiguous real-world business problems clearly and concisely
- Identify the types of evidence needed to investigate a complex pricing or behavioral issue
- Practice formulating a clear and focused research question grounded in platform context
- Begin bridging the gap between business problems and analytical investigation

✅  **Core Concepts to Highlight**

**Business Problem Framing**
Before launching into analysis, analysts must clarify what problem they’re trying to solve. In platform settings, this often means understanding how system design interacts with user incentives—and how those interactions produce outcomes that may be unintended or inefficient.

**Context Before Data**
Students should be encouraged to think about the institutional setup (platform rules, incentive structures, reputational concerns) before asking “what data do I need?” This encourages more grounded and relevant analysis.

**Research Questions as Navigation Tools**
Good research questions are specific, measurable, and decision-relevant. They give direction to an investigation without assuming the answer in advance.

💬 Suggested In-Class Prompts

“What wouldn’t be a useful research question in this case—and why?”

“What data might exist already, and what data might need to be created or requested?”

“How might Uber’s business model shape what kinds of questions are ‘worth answering’?”

📌 **Common Misunderstandings**

- Writing a research question that is too vague or too narrow
- Ignoring the broader context—platform incentives, reputation, fairness, policy—in favor of only technical details
- Forgetting that a research question isn’t just for academic purposes—it’s a tool for making better decisions

**NOTE: This is just one possible way to approach the problem. Your answer might look different depending on what you chose to focus on—and that’s a good thing. This sample reflects a perspective you might take if you were thinking like someone who studies how markets work and how firms and individuals behave within them*

Uber’s pricing system is designed to balance rider demand and driver supply, but when drivers strategically log off to create artificial scarcity, the algorithm is misled. 
This causes prices to surge even when demand hasn’t truly increased. 
That threatens rider trust, distorts platform efficiency, and creates unfair earning opportunities for some drivers at the expense of others. 
To properly assess the situation, we’d want to look at platform data showing coordinated log-off/on patterns across regions and time, and compare those with pricing demand, and driver-riding match outcomes.

**Research question:**
To what extent does coordinated driver log-off behavior inflate surge pricing in Sydney and Melbourne, and what impact does this have on rider wait times and fare levels?
